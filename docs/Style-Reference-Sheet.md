* Damage = cIsDamage
* Healing = cIsHealing
* Utility = cIsUtility
* Health = cIsHealth
* Stack = cStack
* Mono = cMono
* Death = cDeath
* User Settings = cUserSetting
* Artifact = cArtifact
* Sub = cSub
* Event = cEvent
* World Event = cWorldEvent
* Keyword Name = cKeywordName
* Shrine = cShrine

And they looks like this:
