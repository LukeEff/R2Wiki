# Getting Started
ThunderKit is a Unity Extension developed by Passive Picasso (AKA: Twiner) that provides an expansive and expandable environment for mod development. It can be used for developing multiple mods in a single project, ease of testing by streamlining the building and testing processes with automation.

## Why ThunderKit?
ThunderKit contains a good chunk of utilities and features that streamline the mod creation process, including but not limited to:
- Multiple mod projects in a single unity project.
- Automated creation of AssetBundles for RoR2
- Ease of creation on using ContentPacks.
- Access to using the plethora of Scriptable Objects that Risk of Rain 2 has. (which reduces load time since normally by creating them in code it increases the mod's load time)
- Give generally a close aproximation to what Hopoo uses to develop mods.
- Easily manage DLL dependencies and mod dependencies.
- Complete component access and editing via the Editor's Inspector
- Loadable ingame assets using AssetRipper.
- Simplified workload using Addressables with the AddressableBrowser

## What do I need to get started?
One thing to keep in mind: Just like getting used to and learning any mod creation enviroment, learning the basics of ThunderKit and how to use it to its fullest potential takes *time*. Do not be discouraged if you bump into a roadblock or you're not sure how to do something. You can always ask in the the [ThunderKit Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Xzf9qFj6WA)
