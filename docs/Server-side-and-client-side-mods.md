When uploading mods to the Thunderstore, you can tag them both as client-side and/or server-side. This means that the mod needs to be installed on the multiplayer host's computer (server-side) and/or the other players' computers (client-side) in order to work properly.

These tags themselves don't do much, they only help with searching/filtering in the Thundertore. On the code level, you need to declare your mod's attitude towards multiplayer runs. You can do this by decorating your main class (the one derived from `BaseUnityPlugin`) with the [NetworkCompatibility attribute.](https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2API/blob/master/R2API/Utils/NetworkCompatibility.cs)
